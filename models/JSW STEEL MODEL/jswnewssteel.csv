" Exclusive: India's JSW Steel slows process to buy stake in Canada Teck coal unit, source says
    ", 21 Sep 2023 ,"
    
JSW Steel, India's largest steelmaker by capacity, is slowing down the process of buying a stake in the steelmaking coal unit of Canada's Teck Resources. The decision comes amidst a diplomatic spat between India and Canada, which has led to the suspension of visa services for Canadian citizens by India.

The source close to the discussions said that the discussions between JSW Steel and Teck over the stake sale had slowed down, but the paperwork was still ongoing. JSW Steel is waiting for the issue to subside before proceeding further.

JSW Steel declined to comment, while Teck Resources said that they do not comment on market rumors or speculation. Teck's stock fell 4.4% following the Reuters report.

JSW Steel is one of the largest customers of Teck's coal business. The Vancouver-based company has twice rejected an unsolicited $22.5 billion bid for the entire company from global miner and trader Glencore. Teck has received offers from various interested parties for its coal business.

Japan's Nippon Steel has also shown interest in Teck's coal business, having agreed to buy a 10% stake post-split.

The acquisition of a Canadian company by a foreign company would be subject to a national security review under the Investment Canada Act. JSW is in talks with investment banks including Standard Chartered and Deutsche Bank to secure the funding for the transaction.

The final numbers could revolve in the range of 34-37% stake.

Canada is the fourth-largest exporter of coking coal used in the steel business for India, according to Indian government data. The first three are Australia, Russia, and the United States.
