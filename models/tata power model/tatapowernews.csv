"Tata Power shares: Nuvama sees 23% downside, cuts stock price target to Rs 303",12-Feb-24,"
    
Tata Power target price: Nuvama has cut its rating on Tata Power to 'reduce' from 'Hold' with a revised target price of Rs 303, hinting at 23 per cent potential downside.Tata Power share price: Nuvama is watchful of upcoming growth potential from pumped hydro, rooftop solar, C&I PPAs with Tata group for RE, and new distribution privatisation.
Nuvama Institutional Equities expects Tata Power Company Ltd to report a flattish-to-low growth over FY24-25E amid falling coal realisations as it sees rising contribution of renewable energy to take two–three years to play out. The domestic brokerage is watchful of upcoming growth potential from pumped hydro, rooftop solar, C&I PPAs with Tata group for RE, and new distribution privatisation.   For now, Nuvama has cut its rating on Tata Power to 'reduce' from 'Hold' with a revised target price of Rs 303, hinting at 23 per cent potential downside.

In the December quarter, Tata Power reported a consolidated profit after tax of Rs 1,076.12 crore, up 2.28 per cent. Coal profits fell 81 per cent YoY coupled with CGPL losses, offset by growth in solar EPC, Odisha Discom and Tata Projects.

On a nine-month basis, PAT declined 6 per cent YoY, adjusted for one-off dividend from ITPC Zambian asset (past regulatory dues).

""Tata Power had cut its FY27 PAT guidance by Rs 2,000 crore. While the RE business is yet to reach 3-4GW additions/year required to meet FY27 PAT targets, falling coal profits remains a drag. Despite our bull case of CGPL profits u/s11, Coal at 130$, and RE at Rs 40,000 crore deal value, we find 23 per cent downside,"" the domestic brokerage said.  Nuvama assumes CGPL to remain profitable as it expects assume sec-11 benefits to remain till perpetuity (currently till June 2024). The coal profits for the first nine months fell by estimated 81 per cent to Rs 570 crore, on falling coal realisation.

This was offset by rising profits of Solar EPC and Odisha distribution. Tata Power's captive solar module factory has commissioned. It expects to start solar cell production by June 2024.

""Much of this captive cell/module capacity shall be used for captive supply to its solar IPP/EPC/rooftop segments with some export optionality. Tata Power has signed an MoU with Maharashtra government for brownfield development of 2.8GW pumped hydro storage at its existing hydro assets (expected CoD by FY27–28). TPREL has won FDRE projects from SJVN of 1,316MW, solar 460MW, Wind 799MW and BESS 57.5MW,"" Nuvama noted.  Nuvama said Tata Power's net debt as on 9MFY24 stood at Rs 38,600 crore with net debt to equity ratio remaining healthy at 1.04 times, which is expected to grow to 1.5–2 times as capacity expands.

 Shares of Tata Power Company Ltd will be in focus in Wednesday's trade as the company will post its second-quarter results later today. The scrip settled 0.18% higher at ₹250 apiece on the NSE on Tuesday.

Domestic brokerage house Kotak Institutional Equities expects Tata Power's adjusted profit after tax to rise 35.80% year-on-year (YoY) at ₹1,112.40 crore for the July to September quarter. Kotak said sales for the quarter under review may increase 6.6% YoY to ₹15,100 crore.

JM Financial sees net sales for Tata Power to improve 15% to ₹16,096.80 crore on account of the Mundra plant being operational under Section-11, as well as higher generation from renewables portfolio. Profit, it said, may improve 13% YoY to ₹928.30 crore on the back of reduction in AT&C losses in Odisha circle and lower losses from Mundra plant.

Tata Power shares have clocked decent gains of 23% in the last six months but have seen limited gains of 8% in the last one year. The Tata Group stock is among the top picks of IDBI Capital with a target price of ₹339, indicating a further upside of 35.6% from the current market levels.

IDBI Capital cited strong power demand behind its bullish stance. The likely upside is also supported by CGPL Mundra plant of the company turning profitable, as per the brokerage. ""In Mundra, losses are restricted due to cost pass-through benefits under Section-11 and thus need to watch for signing of long-term power purchase agreement. And this will resolve long pending concern for Tata Power.""

Tata Power's Q2 results are expected to be driven by higher revenue from core businesses of generation, transmission and distribution. The company's adherence to financial discipline, operational excellence along with business resilience and diversification has helped it in maintaining consistent profit growth.

The company is focusing on new areas of growth such as a greenfield solar cell and module manufacturing plant in Tamil Nadu, which has produced its first module in this quarter and is on track to roll out the first cell into Q4FY24.

The net debt to underlying EBITDA improved to 2.65x during the second quarter from 2.73x in Q1 and net debt to equity was bettered to 1.02x.

The company’s clean energy portfolio achieved the milestone of 5,500 MW during the reporting quarter, standing at 38% of total installed generation capacity.

Tata Power, one of India's largest integrated power companies, is set to announce its Q1 results for the financial year 2023 (FY23) on July 29, 2022. Analysts expect the company's EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) to rise by 58% YoY to ₹2,850 crore, driven by improved performance from its Mundra plant and other core businesses.

The Mundra plant, which has been a drag on the company's financials in the past, is expected to perform better in Q1 FY23 due to the implementation of the Section-11 provision, which allows the company to pass on the increase in coal prices to its customers. The company has also been able to reduce its debt levels, which is likely to improve its profitability.

In addition to the Mundra plant, the company's other core businesses, such as generation, transmission, and distribution, are also expected to perform well in Q1 FY23. The company's renewable energy portfolio, which accounts for 38% of its total installed generation capacity, is also expected to contribute positively to its earnings.

Analysts expect Tata Power's revenue to grow by 15% YoY to ₹11,500 crore in Q1 FY23, driven by higher revenue from its core businesses and new areas of growth. The company's net profit is expected to grow by 40% YoY to ₹750 crore in Q1 FY23.

Investors will be closely monitoring the company's performance in Q1 FY23, especially its Mundra plant's performance, as it has been a key monitorable for the company. The company's adherence to financial discipline, operational excellence, and business resilience and diversification is likely to drive its performance in the quarter.

Tata Power has been focusing on new areas of growth, such as a greenfield solar cell and module manufacturing plant in Tamil Nadu, which has produced its first module in this quarter and is on track to roll out the first cell into Q4FY24. The net debt to underlying EBITDA improved to 2.65x during the second quarter from 2.73x in Q1 and net debt to equity was bettered to 1.02x.

The company’s clean energy portfolio achieved the milestone of 5,500 MW during the reporting quarter, standing at 38% of total installed generation capacity. In the renewable energy business, the total renewables capacity of Tata Power Renewable Energy stood at 7,961 MW with an installed capacity of 4,206 MW and 3,755 MW under various stages of implementation. The utility scale order book was at 3.7 GW worth Rs 15,870 crore with the rooftop solar and group captive order book at Rs 2,872 crore.

In conclusion, Tata Power's Q1 FY23 results are expected to be positive, with EBITDA likely to rise by 58% YoY and revenue expected to grow by 15% YoY. The company's Mundra plant's performance and its adherence to financial discipline, operational excellence, and business resilience and diversification are likely to drive its performance in the quarter.

  Tata Power shares hit one-year high; stock up 14% in a month. Is more steam left?

    
    ",24 Aug 2023,"
    
    Tata Power shares hit a one-year high on Tuesday, extending their gains for the fourth straight session. The stock jumped 3 per cent to hit a 52-week high of Rs 252.75. It eventually settled 1.69 per cent higher at Rs 249.55 over its previous close of Rs 245.40. The scrip has gained 13.83 per cent in the past one month. It has ascended by 25.06 per cent in six months and 17.91 per cent in 2023 so far.

Today's fresh upward move came after Tata Power said it has entered into a pact with Zoomcar. ""Tata Power EV Charging Solutions Limited (TPEVCSL), a Tata Power group Company, and Zoomcar, a leading marketplace for car sharing, have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to promote widespread electric vehicle adoption and deliver a seamless, user-friendly charging experience to EV users nationwide,"" the company stated in an exchange filing.

This collaboration aims to promote Tata Power's EZ Charge points on the Zoomcar platform and would focus on supporting existing and aspiring EV owners along with Zoomcar's existing customers, it mentioned.

The company also said it aims to establish 25,000 charging points in the next five years, bolstering the national EV ecosystem and driving sustainable mobility growth.

In a separate development, Tata Power said Hemant Bhargava, non-executive, non-independent director, has stepped down from the Board of Directors of the company with effect from August 23, 2023.

On the earnings front, the Tata Group firm reported a 22.40 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in consolidated net profit for the quarter ended June 2023 (Q1 FY24) to Rs 972.49 crore. Consolidated revenue from operations grew around 5 per cent to Rs 15,213.29 crore (YoY).

Brokerage view

""Management plans to scale up RE capacity to 15.0GW by FY25 from the current 4.1GW; increase focus on the power distribution business; and seize opportunity in the solar EPC business. We retain our positive stance and reiterate 'Buy' for a target price of Rs 272,"" Elara Capital stated.

""FY23 was a record year for windfall gains in coal for Tata Power. In FY24, that trend is unlikely to repeat itself. For instance, the company has made up for the loss in coal profit through a strong revival in Odisha DISCOMs; an increase in RE assets contributing to higher EBITDA; and a favorable order in Maithon. The benefits of a diversified portfolio are playing out, with EBITDA - even in an adverse scenario - showing resilience. We maintain 'Buy' at a target price of Rs 275,"" Antique Stock Broking said.

India's Tata Power posts 15% jump in Q4 profit on robust demand

    
    ",08 May 2024,"
    
   BENGALURU (Reuters) - India's Tata Power reported a jump in fourth-quarter profit on Wednesday, helped by strong energy demand amid heatwaves and growing economic activity in the country.

The company reported a consolidated net profit of 8.95 billion rupees ($107.2 million), up around 15% from last year.

Analysts had said energy firms such as Tata Power, NTPC and Power Grid would likely announce consistent fourth-quarter earnings as the sector stood to gain from increasing thermal and renewable energy capacity.

Searing heatwaves and an uptick in economic activity have resulted in India's electricity generation growing at an average of about 8% annually following the pandemic year of 2020/21, outpacing power demand growth in every major global economy.

The company's transmission and distribution segment, which brings in the lion's share of revenue, grew 8.80% to 90.25 billion rupees, while its generation segment clocked in a growth of 68%.

Overall revenue from operations climbed 27% to 158.47 billion rupees. The company also recommended a final dividend of 2 rupees per share for the financial year 2024.

Its total expenses rose about 24% to 156.91 billion rupees, led mainly by a near two-fold surge in fuel costs.

Shares of Tata Power closed lower at 0.3% on Wednesday ahead of results. The stock has climbed about 18% in the reporting quarter, outperforming a 16.6% rise in the Nifty Energy index.

We are on track to grow very quickly next year and in subsequent years: Tata Power CEO
    
    ",10 May 2024,"
    The company plans to invest nearly Rs 20,000 crore in FY25, of which half will be on renewable energy, with the rest divided between generation and pump hydro.Tata Power Company’s initiatives and investments across businesses in the last 12 months will start showing results in the next 12-18 months, says Managing Director and Chief Executive Praveer Sinha.

In the last four years, the company has invested Rs 40,000 crore to build capacity and plans to invest another Rs 20,000 crore in FY25 alone. Almost half of this will be in renewable business.

In an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol, Sinha talks about the company’s growth plans and how it will finance the growth.

Edited excerpts follow:Q. FY24 witnessed strong power demand—it's been over 10% in the last two months. Help me understand how that has translated into numbers for you?  This is the 18th consecutive quarter of profit growth that we have seen. In the last three years, there has been a huge increase in power demand. In the last two months, demand has grown upwards of 10% and I expect that this year also there will be a huge increase in power demand. There are three reasons for this: a pickup in industrial activity, more commercial activity, and heat-wave conditions. More air-conditioning usage is taking place even in tier 2 and tier 3 cities.

We also see that affordability has improved and more power is being utilised. There has been a general increase in power consumption and Tata Power has benefited from this by setting up more capacity—a lot of capacity addition has happened and more is lined up this year and in subsequent years. In fact, we have 4.5 gigawatts (GW) of operating assets in renewable and another 5.5 GW is under implementation, which will get completed in the next 24 months.

To cater to the renewable energy capacity, more transmission lines are coming and Tata Power has won two bids recently and two last year. All four projects are under implementation. As more renewable energy capacity is added, more transmission facilities have to be created and Tata Power will play a very active role in that.

In power distribution, operations in Odisha have stabilised. In fact, with the stabilisation of the network and better quality of service, consumption has increased.

Q. Tata Power is evolving from being a power generation company to having a more diversified portfolio with transmission, distribution and even manufacturing. How was the performance of the different businesses in FY24 and what do you expect in FY25?

In FY24, the main businesses—generation, transmission, distribution and renewables—have stabilised. We saw excellent performance from our generation business and they continue to improve every year in terms of availability and operational parameters and efficiencies. Similarly, in transmission, we see all our networks operating very well and a lot of capacity addition has taken place in Mumbai, where we keep on improving the network.

We also see that the renewable businesses have started doing very well. The 4 GW manufacturing facility has been set up. The modules plant is fully operational and has started supplying. The cell plant will get operational next month and we expect that it will reach full capacity by September. For many of the things that we have done in the last 12 months, the results will start showing in the next 12 to 18 months.

In Odisha Discom, there were initially a lot of hiccups but the discom has been making profits. (Note: Between 2020 and 2021, Tata Power won the bid to manage operations of all four Odisha discoms, in a public-private partnership model). We expect this profit to improve in the subsequent years. I think you would see that the company and all its businesses have virtually stabilised and will improve with more capacity addition, which will happen in renewables, as well as in transmission and distribution.

We are quite gung-ho about the fact that we are on a track to grow very quickly next year and in subsequent years. I think you will see an excellent performance from Tata Power.

Q. Last year you said that you have an ambitious plan to invest Rs 60,000 crore over the next three years. How much of this has been done and can you share the plans for the current fiscal year and next?

In the last four years, we have already invested Rs 40,000 crore. In the last financial year, we invested Rs 12,000 crores in various businesses. This financial year, in FY25, we have a target to invest nearly Rs 20,000 crore, out of which nearly 50% is in the renewables business.

In our transmission and distribution businesses in Delhi, Mumbai and Odisha, new capital investment will be done to improve the network and technology. Similarly, in renewable projects, a lot of capacity additions are being planned.

We will be getting ready not only for those projects that get implemented in FY25 but also the initial work that needs to be carried out for projects that will be implemented in FY25. So, there is a very ambitious plan to invest Rs 20,000 crore this year (FY25) and Rs 60,000 crore over four years. And we would continue to see the same type of investment happening as we move forward year on year.

Q. You have a lot of debt and you need to finance your big investment plans. What is the debt situation right now and how do you plan to raise funds to finance growth?

If you see our performance in the last four years, from a debt-to-equity ratio of 3.5, we have now come to 1.1. Our net debt is only Rs 38,000 crore in spite of Rs 40,000 crore that we have invested in the last 4 years. That means that we are generating very good EBITDA in cash in the company, which is used to a large extent to repay the old debt and also to fund capital. And of course, we will continue to take some new debt for the new investment.

And even with the new investment that we have planned, we will be in a very, very safe zone as far as debt-equity or debt-EBITDA is concerned. And typically, for infrastructure projects, these are much higher. Our focus is that we generate more of the cash from the new investments so that we can use it for future investments for the growth of the company.

Q. Is there scope for more improvement in the Odisha discom operations? 

We have been able to clean up a lot of things that were there regarding giving and collection. That has helped us now reach a level whereby you will see that for subsequent years, the profit will be substantially higher than it was. We expect that the benefit of the new technology or the investment in the network and in personal service will get translated into a better performance by the company going forward. The best is yet to come; in FY25 and FY26, we will see much more improvement than in the previous year.

Q. Are you looking at more discom opportunities?

Absolutely, I am looking at all the states. I do expect that multiple suppliers of electricity will happen. Some of these states might go for a similar model as Odisha's technology model seeing the success and turnaround of the operations; it’s a win-win for everyone. I expect that out of these 27 states and the union facilities that are not under a private distribution arrangement, many will go for similar arrangements and I am very confident that Tata Power will play a very significant role in this.


Q. The Mundra plant continues to operate under Section-11, which was imposed by the government. This allows full passthrough of fuel costs. But what after Section 11 is lifted? What’s the update on the supplementary power purchase agreements (PPAs) that you have to sign with states? (Note: Section 11 of the Electricity Act states that in extraordinary circumstances, the government can ask power generating companies to operate and maintain output in accordance with its directions).
The Mundra Plant has been operating under Section 11 and it has been able to supply power to all the beneficiary states. The power continues to be one of the lowest in all the power procurement being done. In the merit order, it is still very efficient and all the beneficiary states continue to schedule power from this, even under Section 11. And that goes to prove the efficiency of the Mundra Plant. Going forward, a solution has to be found, something that is similar to the Section 11 solution. We are in discussions, but as you know, Section 11 has been extended to October 14. And I am sure at the right place or right time, we will be able to conclude an amendment that is acceptable to all the states.

Q. This is the second year that we are operating under Section 11. Has this become the new normal; do you see the government extending this in future as well?

That’s a call the government has to take. The government enforces Section 11. As far as we are concerned, the plant is always ready to operate, but it has to be cost effective.

Q. Tata Power now has different businesses. What are the value unlocking opportunities here?

There are a lot of synergies. When we talk of 4 GW manufacturing capacity, the majority will be used internally for our captive, rooftop projects and a very small quantity will be sold in the market. This gives us certainty both in terms of the price as well as the quality of the panels or solar modules that will be supplied. The second thing is that these are bundled solutions. If today we have to give 24x7 renewable power, the pump hydro comes from the generation business. The transmission and distribution knowledge of how to schedule power and how to supply 24x7 comes from our distribution business. We need to look at them in totality rather than looking at them in silos or in a segmented way. And I think this is the strength of Tata Power. We are able to provide comprehensive solutions and not just standalone energy.

Q. Your renewable energy arm raised funds but is there a plan for a potential listing of the subsidiary at some stage?

It is too premature. Let us first go ahead and implement all these projects. We will take a call at the right time.
